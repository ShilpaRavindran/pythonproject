Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava on Tuesday said all procedures
laid down in the law were followed during the arrest of Disha Ravi from Bengaluru.
Shrivastava told mediapersons that law does not differentiate on the basis of age.
â€œLaw does not differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old.
